# Installation instructions (Windows)

Step 1:

Step 2:
Install VLC Media Player

Step 3:
Get an API key for the YouTube Data API v3
To do that go to this link: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/

Step 4:
Run install.bat, this is an installer that will prompt you for any information that is needed for the installation

If you ever want to change the configuration of the assistant, you can edit env_vars.py in the Src folder. This stores your API key, the assistant wakeword, VLC installation directory, etc.
